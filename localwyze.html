			<p>This was my third project at General Assembly. It was a group project that aimed to help people find items they would want to buy, locally. The idea came from a story that, one time I had driven about 25 miles to make a purchase in Downtown LA only to find the same item a week later at a local shop 2 miles from my home. So the group set out to create a place where business owners could post their items and customers could browse those items based on promity to them. My main role in this project was working with the google maps API and a subrole of styling.</p>
			<h4>Tech used:</h4>
			<p>HTML, CSS, Twitter BootStrap, JavaScript, Google maps API, Ruby on Rails, and PostgreSQL.</p>
