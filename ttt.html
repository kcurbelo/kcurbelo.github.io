			<p>This was my first project at General Assembly. It was a 2-player Tic-Tac-Toe game. The most enjoyable and challenging aspect of this project was the game logic. I have played this game countless times and the rules have always been self explainitory. However, a computer doesn't know the rules so I had to make them! Thinking in such a way so that the rules can be programmed into a two player game was very challenging. However, this was also the most rewarding part of the project because it pushed me into putting those rules and logic into a language the computer could understand. </p>
			<h4>Tech used:</h4>
			<p>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular, and Firebase.</p>
